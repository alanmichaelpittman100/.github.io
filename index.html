<h1>Alan Michael Pittman</h1>
<p style="font-family:futura;">

I am a senior lecturer in computational genetics at St. Georges, University of London and have research interests ranging from human genomics, rare-diseases and population genetics. I am particularly interested in new genetic technologies and their applications, including, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, genetic mosaicism detection and functional genomics.</p>

<p style="font-family:garamond;">Prior to SGUL, I worked at UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, where I was developing new methods in the ‘next-generation sequencing’ era to study the genetic landscape of human neurological disease. Before that I was a post-doctoral research fellow at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and researching into germline predisposition to a variety of tumor types.</p>
